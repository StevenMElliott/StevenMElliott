# Data Analyst / Machine Learning Engineer
## ðŸ‘‹ About Me :
I am a data scientist that specializes in data analysis and machine learning. Using data to make informed decisions makes me happy. I also love the insights gained from a good machine learning model. I am comfortable working with SQL, Python and Tableau currently. When I have a concrete goal to work towards, I can learn whatever new tech is needed to accomplish that goal. For example, I used several new-to-me libraries, Docker, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk in order to deliver my last project.  I am currently looking for opportunities in Utah, but I am willing to relocate for the right opportunity.
